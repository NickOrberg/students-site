# Octave tasks

## Create matrices `octave-matrices`

Create the following matrices. Create an octave function that returns a matrix. Name the
function as proposed in bold at the beginning of each task.

Please, use only methods that were discussed at the lecture. That is, for example, don't
use loops and functions such as `repmat`. And try to find a short solution, that is, don't
enter all the values manually.

    .................
    ``` 
1. **task10**.

   You are given a number `n`. Create the matrix of size $n\times n$ of the 
   following structure: Its main diagonal has numbers 1 and 2 that go. Дальше от каждой клетки главной диагонали направо и вниз расставляется то же числа, что и в самой этой клетке. Пример для аргумента (5):
   ```
   1 1 1 1 1
   1 2 2 2 2
   1 2 1 1 1
   1 2 1 2 2
   1 2 1 2 1
   ```
   Try to avoid loops.
   Additional question. What is a determinant of this matrix? Can you explain, 
   why the determinant is as it is?

## Indexing `octave-indexing`

1. ***task1***
You are given a square matrix of an even size. (you are not supposed to test that the matrix is actually even and square, just
use it). Imagine we split a matrix vertically and horizontally through the center. Return the matrix at the left-top.
1. ***task2***
You are given a matrix with an even number of rows. Return a new matrix where the top half is exchanged with the bottom half of the
initial matrix.
1. ***task3***
You are given a vector with integer numbers. Return a vector that contains only that numbers of the initial vector, that are
divisible by 3. Use the `mod` function to test divisibilty.
1. ***task4*** Given a vector of integer numbers, return a vector with the same
numbers, but where even numbers are divided by 2. Will your solution work if
the matrix is 2 dimensional?
1. Create two functions ***filter_multiples*** and ***seive***. The first one is `filter_multiples(a, k)`,
it removes all numbers from the vector `a` that are divisible
by `k` and are strictly greater than `k`. For example, `filter_multiples([1 5 10], 5)` yields `[1 5]`

    The second one is `sieve(n)`, and it implements [the Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).
    You will probably need to use the while loop. 
1. ***task6*** You are given a matrix with two columns. Each column describes
an animal: its height in meters and weight in kg. 
Return the following set of answers:
    * sum of animals' heights
    * mean height of animals
    * mean height of animals that are higher than 100 kg
    * one column matrix with the body mass index (BMI) of animals. BMI is equal to
        weight divided by the square of height.
    * two columns matrix with animals, that are higher than 10 meters, and heaver than 100 kg.
    
## Vectorization `octave-vectorization`

1. ***task1***
You are given a row matrix, for example, `a = [1, 2, -2, 4]` and a number `x`, for example, 1.
The row `a` specifies coefficients of a polinomial, starting from the lowest degree, that is, the row from
the example specifies the polynomial
\\(1 + 2x - 2x^2 + 4x^3\\). Compute the value of the polinomial at the point `x`.
The answer in the example is 5.
1. ***task2***
You are given a column matrix \\(x\\). Create a square matrix of the same size, its value in the row number \\(i\\) and the column
number \\(j\\) should be equal to \\(a_{i,j} = x_i – x_j\\).
1. ***task3*** You are given a three columns matrix. Imagine, that each row specifies a line of the form \\(ax + by + c = 0\\),
whith the columns being, correspondingly, `a`, `b`, `c`. Return a matrix,
that has two columns, vcorrespondingly, `k` и `b`, that define the same lines, but in the form \\(y = kx + b\\). For example, the row `[1 1 1]` should be converted to the row `[-1 -1]`.
1. ***all2dets(x)***. You are given a matrix `x` of two columns. Return a new square matrix with the size equal to the number of rows in `x`. An element in the row number \\(i\\) and the column
number \\(j\\) should be equal to \\(a_{i,j} = \\left|\\begin{matrix}x_{i,1}&x_{i,2}\\\\x_{j,1} &x_{j,2}\\end{matrix}\\right|\\).
This is a determinant of a matrix composed from the i-th and the j-th rows of `x`. I remind that
\\(\\left|\\begin{matrix}a&b\\\\c&d\\end{matrix}\\right|=ad - bc\\).
1. ***all_lines_intersections(a)***.
You are given a matrix `а` of three columns, it describes a set of lines (as previously). The short task statement is: intersect each line with each line. To be more specific: the intersection of the line from the i-th row and the line from j-th row has two coordinates \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). The function should return two matrices `x` and `y`. The first one contains the x-coordinate of this intersection in the row \\(i\\) and the column \\(j\\). The second one contains, correspondingly, the y-coordinate. Don't consider the case of parallel lines.

    Here is the formula for intersection of lines \\(a_1x+b_1y+c_1\\) = 0 and \\(a_2x+b_2y+c_2 = 0\\):
    
        Δ = det([a1 b1; a2 b2])
        Δx = det([-c1 b1; -c2 b2])
        Δy = det([a1 -c1; a2 -c2])
        x = Δx / Δ
        y = Δy / Δ
            
    So, you will need a previously implemented `all2dets` function.
    
## Linear equations `octave-linear-equations`.

1. ***task1*** You are given `n`, find roots of the polynomial
\\(x^n + x^{n - 1} + \\cdots + x + 1\\), that is a polynomial of degree \\(n\\),
that has all coefficints equal to 1. Return roots as one row-matrix.
    * Make the function `task1` also plot the roots on a complex plane.
    Just call `plot` for the matrix with roots.
    * comment out the `plot` that you have just made. Extract real and imaginary
    parts of the roots and then plot them again by supplying real-valued
    x and y coordinates of the roots.
1. ***task2*** Solve the equation \\(x + \\sin(x)=1\\).
1. ***task3*** solve the system of equations
      \\(\begin{cases} x + \\sin(y) = 1 \\\\ y + \\cos(x) = 1 \end{cases}\\)
1. ***task4*** You are given a real number `a`. Solve the equation
\\(e^x - e^{-x}=a\\). Return for results from the function:
    * Solve with `fsolve`.
    * Solve with `fzero`, you will need to specify a segment where to search for the solution. 
    * Solve with an explicit expression. Think, how to express `x` in terms of `a`.
    * The difference between solutions with the explicit expression and with `fsolve`.
        
    test your function on `a = 1 000 000`.
1. ***task_circles*** The circle is specified with a matrix of three values:
`[x, y, r]`, that is its center and its radius. You are given two circles.
Find their intersections. To do this, create a system of two equations,
and use `fsolve` to solve it. Your function should return a matrix
with two rows, where intersection points are defined by columns.
The function should also draw both circles and use a special marker to
mark intersections. Don't use an explicit expression for evaluating intersections and
don't do any geometry. Just use `fsolve`.
    * To start, find at least one intersection point
    * Then find both points. Think, what initial points should be specified for `fsolve`.
1. ***domino.m***. Based on [http://www.math.cornell.edu/~levine/18.312/alg-comb-lecture-18.pdf](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~levine/18.312/alg-comb-lecture-18.pdf)
   
   You are given natural numbers $m$ and $n$, they are the size of a rectangles made of
   cells. There are $m\times n$ cells, they are numbered from $1$ to $m\cdot n$.
   
   Create a matrix $A$ of size $m\cdot n\times m\cdot n$, in which the element at $i,j$ contains:
   
   * 1, if cells $i$ and $j$ are next to each other horizontally,
   * complex unit ($\texttt i$), if cells $i$ and $j$ are next to each other vertically,
   * 0 otherwise
   
   Evaluate the determinant of $A$ and take the square root of it.
   You will get the number of domino tilings of a $m\times n$ rectangle.
